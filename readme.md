# SOLID Design Principles

A set of software design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin.

These principles help to create clean and reusable code.

> Go to SOLID package to see a detail description and a demo for each of the SOLID principles.

# Design Patterns

* Common architectural approaches that work well for frequent kind of problems  in software engineering.

* Good for creating reusable object-oriented software.

* Can be translated to many other programming languages.

* Universally relevant

The aim of design patterns is to make software design more understandable and maintainable.

## Gamma Categorization

Design patterns are typically split into three categories. This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of the GoF authors.

## Creational Patterns

* Deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
* Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (Dependency Injection, refleciton, etc).
* Wholesale (single statement to create an object) vs piecewise (step-by-step creation).

*In software engineering creational patters provide various object creaetion mechanisms which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.*

## Structural Patters

* Concerned with the structure of a class (e.g, class members).
* How to increase the functionality of a class.
* Many patters are wrappers taht mimic the underlaying class interface.
* Stress the importance of good API design. Makes objects and API usable for other people.

*Structural design paters are about how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures. The structural design patterns simplifies the structure of software components by identifying the relationships between them.*

## Behavioral Patters

* Dealing with how to communicate effectively between given classes.
* They are all different; no central theme.

*In software engineering behavioural design patterns identify common communication patterns between objects. These patterns increase flexibility in carrying out the communication.*
